# v1.2
WHATS_NEW = """\
This release does not contain new features or break compatibility in \
any way.

- caterpillar (https://github.com/zmwangx/caterpillar) is now \
automatically installed as a dependency through pip.

- Improve onboarding experience.

- Issue warnings when performance VODs returned are 720p instead of \
1080p (see https://github.com/SNH48Live/KVM48/issues/7). This has \
been the norm since early November, and there's nothing to be done \
on the client side, but it's probably a good idea to alert users to \
the fact and inform them that the client has tried its best.

- Include more info about the execution environment when --debug is on.

- Link to issue reporting guidelines when the program halts due to \
non-recoverable exceptions.
